Cucumber - BDD Behaviour Driven Development

	A process to ensure collaboration between 3 amigos : Business , Dev , QA  to have common shared understanding on the aceptence criteria that matter most to the customers

 BDD frameworks have 2 layers/sides.



    #1- Business side --> feature files
        - We write the features in Gherkin language (which is English)
        - It is understanble for technical and non-technical people in the team

        - Given, When, Then, And etc

    #2- Implementation side --> step_definitions package
        - We implement each "scenario" STEP BY STEP
        - Each step is different from each other
        - Once a step is created, it is basically a re-usable method (from the step_definition side)

   NOTE :
   	    ---> Cucumber is BDD tool, that allows us to implement BDD approach.
		---> Cucumber does NOT have assertions that comes with it.
		---> That's why we are using JUnit (Unit testing tool) to use assertions come from that library.

 

CukesRunner ==============
   
    - The whole project is controlled by the Runner (CukesRunner) class
    - Thats why we need to make sure Runner class is connected to rest of the project
    - Meaning:
        - CukesRunner class should know where the step definitions are (glue)
        - CukesRunner class should know where the feature files are stored (feature)
        - CukesRunner class should know whether I want to dryRun true or false (dryRun)
        - CukesRunner class should know what kind of report I want to generate (plugin)
        - CukesRunner class should know which tests I want to run (tags)


   Q : How does Runner class know where to find and compare "feature" files and "step definitions"?
   
	    - We provide paths in our Runner class @CucumberOptions

	    - @Cucumber Options -- stands for specifiying cucumber test parameters, location of stepdefs / feature etc.


	    glue = the path of the step_definitions package
	    
	    features = the path of the directory where all .feature files are stored

		== 1. DryRun 	==

		- dryRun decides if we actually want to run the code implemetaion (java+selenium) or if we want to just get the snippets(unimplemented step definition methods)

		    - it accepts a boolean value:

		    - if dryRun is "true":
		        - it means it is "turned ON"
		        - when its true, it will NOT execute the code implementation
		        - it will not open the browser and run the java+selenium code etc.
		        - it will ONLY check if there are any steps in feature file that does not have matching snippet in the step_definitions package

		    - if dryRun is "false":
		        - it means it is "turned OFF"
		        - your code will be executed as normal
		        - and if there are unimplemented steps, it still provides snippets for them.

		== 2. Tags ==

		 
		    - Tags are used to group different Feature files and scenarios together to be able to run them in different test suites.
		        - @SmokeTest Suite
		        - @Regression Suite


		    - If we put the tag on top of the feature file it effects the whole feature file. It will run all scenarios in that feature file
		    - If we put the tag on top of a scenario(s), it will only run those specific scenario(s)



StepDefinitons ================

	==1. Hooks ==

		Methods that execute before and after scenarios. Hook will always run, even if the scenario fails.

		There is no connection between feature files and hooks. 
		Hooks will run always so we need to be careful about what we use inside.

Feature ================
 
 What is a FEATURE?
    
    - Agile story/User story
    - We create "Test Cases" from "Agile Stories"
    - We create "Scenarios" from Features.

- What is a scenario?
   
    - EACH TEST CASE WE CREATE FROM AGILE STORY.
    - BUT WE DONT CALL THEM TEST CASES IN BDD, WE CALL THEM SCENARIOS.

- Can we have more than 1 agile story under 1 feature file.
    
    - Technically you can, but ideally it is better to seperate.

- What is a step?
   
    - Steps are how we create/re-create that specific scenario.
    - Each step is like a re-usable method.
    - We can write once, and re-use as much as we need it.
    - When re-using a step, make sure it fits perfectly with the flow of that specific scenario.

- What is a snippet?
    - Unimplemented step definition methods that are provided to us from Cucumber by default.

1. == Parameters ==
	
	Parameters in cucumber allows us to use data from feature file to step definitions.
	When you typing your steps if you use double quotes cucumber will understand you are passing string, and it will create step definition based on that. 

	So this usage allow us to reuse same step with different input.

2. == Gherkin ==

		Given ---> Describe an initial context 
	    When  ---> Describe an event 
	    Then  ---> Describe an expected outcome 
	    
3. == BackGround ==
  
     - will allow us to have repeating set-up steps ONLY 1 time in the feature file.
     
     - if we write in once, we don't have to have seperately for each scenario repeatedly.

     - Background will only be applied to "Scenario"s in the current .feature file.
    
     - We can only create pre-condition 

     - We can not make it run after each Scenario.

     - When we use Background, we MUST make sure ALL of the scenarios are able to continue where the steps from Background left off.




Questions :


- Does it matter the order of snippets in step_definitions?
   
    - No. Because the Cucumber will be running the code in the order of the feature file and steps

- Differences between "Background" and "Hooks"?

	 - Background only applies to current feature file.
	 - Hooks can be applied to the whole project.
	 - Hooks can be also limited to apply to certain scenarios with certain @tags ("value" keyword)
	 - We can also create running order using "order" keyword.
